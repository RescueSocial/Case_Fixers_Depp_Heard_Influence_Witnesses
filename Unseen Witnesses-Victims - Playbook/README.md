<b>Unseen Witnesses-Victims - Playbook - Folder:</b>

This folder alleges the playbook of how witnesses and victims are interfered with. --- <i>[Keep Talking to Your Friends and Socializing]</i> ---
<br>Typically, the <s>unconscionable idea, depending on how it's litigated or dismissable, </s> is to make witnesses and victims turn against each other... 
<br>
The resources to do this are intensified when it involves public figures - who are given gatekeeping access to media/journalists - and insider threats. 
<br>Meanwhile, a witness/victim may be a low-income person, an ex-staffer from decades ago, a school friend, a former friend of the opposition, 
a model or actress that's been minimized, a former character reference... If they're all intimidated or supposedly 'impeached' then...
<br>
<b><i>This is the Unpleasant Trenches that are supposedly "the Underbelly" of Hollywood. </i></b>

Secondly, it's intensified by the manipulation of recording laws (Western vs Eastern States, e.g.), and false claims of having preferences to access enforcement. 
<b><br>If you ever watched <i>The Proposal Movie</i> with Sandra Bullock and Ryan Renolds, it's the exact fictional script of the INS Officer intimidating the characters with conspiracy/fraud <i>(it's reversing witness interference to create fear of communications)</i>.</b>

<br>It's very comedic, but imagine this intensified to reality and revolving abuse, violence, rather than merely a fictional marriage.

This is sadly actually a very scary experience that feels (or is) extortionary. It meanwhile, continues. This is further a warning to everyone to know how to refute these manipulations and interferences.
<br>Protecting witnesses/victims is essential, but sadly it's been forced upon the victims themselves to understand/recognize, which is difficult. 
<br>As seen, even people with doctoral degrees are studying this case and how it impacted society.

When donations, paychecks/nonpaychecks, supporters, friends, are thrown around with 'sides' (there really is no 'side'), it becomes difficult to ever respond to. It becomes, blackmail, including through 2ndary parties.
<br>Again, it's essential to understand how influential these cases are to society/to the victims lives themselves and to never stop talking to your witnesses/other victims (and Your Friends) - if possible.

<i>Vague in this commentary</i> -- but the files when interpreted in a 3rd party context speak for themselves - clearly Elon Musk and Amber Heard were extorted and blackmailed falsely from the onset - hence she cannot talk to any of her friends or anyone. This is why financial information and Donations are to be PRIVATE and PROTECTED... Same goes for witness lists, but as complained about already by Howell ironically, there are little to no court recourses unless the victims of it figure it out themselves (and in time).

This can be like a Machette Kills 2013 movie. 
<br>Especially since we're, ahem, not allowed to ever speak to Amber's lawyers in any clear manner and only to her opposition, nor is she allowed to have character references anymore... Insider threats can cost companies millions of dollars, and apparently, society has issues too.
