It's essential for this to turn into <i>Something Good</i> - <i><b>"focus on the future"</b></i> ... This can be, in at least some ways with review for a long-term benefit. <i>Countless</i> organizations and people were impacted. <i>Most cases like this are unable to be studied, and this gives that opportunity. </i>
  <br>We hope victims of abuse can see what happened in a <b>Perspective</b> as a reason to do Community Aid for people abused - despite the Fixers, spin doctoring, pulling both ends, and even interference with publicity.</i>
  <br><b>The Truth is a Lion to be Released</b> and we wish the best for Amber Heard, including that her friendships, career, witnesses, and life flourishes as situations and understanding improves. Amici tried to repair and bandage the case's impact.

- <i><b>Amber Heard Did Not Get a Fair Case - Spin Doctoring 2019-Present:</b></i>
<br> <i>Amicus Briefs typically look at legal issues, not discovered evidence....</i>
<br>There were insider threats to this case, like hollywood fixers determined to destroy, and witness interference which should have dismissed the case, and unjustly this was spun on origins with us unable to properly respond.
<br><i>- (The <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-reviews/sin-eater-the-crimes-of-anthony-pellicano-documentary-review-1235343104/">American Docuseries on Anthony Pellicano scrapes the surface</a> - when they get into cases as insiders with false misrepresentation and the 'team' doesn't understand 'fixers,' it's horrific.)</i>

<br>Those issues are ongoing, and as 3rd parties, we should consider the effect of spin doctoring and the massive amounts of evidence, Witnesses which were Available, and on our society as a whole.
- The below Open Letter with over <a href="https://amberopenletter.com/">300 Organizations and Experts</a> was after 2 years of researching social media and after months of looking into the surface of witness interference. Long-term, it's essential to open-source what happened for <b>ethical review. </b>

With resilience, you can see <b>Amber Heard's Good Character</b> from an archived official website: http://web.archive.org/web/20120118112943/http://amberheardofficial.com/
- <b>We look forward to Amber Heard being Mera in Aquaman 2 - for domestic abuse victims everywhere and for organizations long-term, it would be positive to see her resilience.</b>

It's important to compare and contast. What happened between 2019 and 2023?
<br>How can someone go from a winning case, and having decades of evidence and witnesses available, to practically being extorted?
<br>Why do Press Associations previously join to protect Sources of editorials, then buckle?
<br>How can friends of decades or years become afraid, including of false incrimination?
<br>How can someone go from being a humanitarian to devastated, and then thankfully, life-rafted? 
<br>What are Hollywood Fixers continuing to do over years, and what's the playbook?
<br>Where do previous witnesses go?

This GitHub seeks to point one into the direction of finding out.

<i>What's a Hollywood Fixer? -
<br>They've been working on cases for over 30 years, some of the most known cases of our times are the same 'fixers' and they can harm their clients by taking info, strategy, and witness names to the opposition - (falsely) blackmailing, pulling both ends, causing perpetual terror and chaos -

## <b>An Open Letter in Support of Amber Heard - Over 300 Organizations and Experts:</b><br>

https://amberopenletter.com/

<b><i>Released in November, before appeals were filed for Amber Heard on November 23 -- in a struggle to catch up to both insider and online manipulation in an age where public figures utilize it, but deny it:</b></i>

"Five months ago, the verdict in the defamation trial between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard deeply concerned many professionals in the fields of intimate partner and sexual violence.
<br>As many, including A.O. Scott for The New York Times have noted, the vilification of Ms. Heard and ongoing online harassment of her and those who have voiced support for her have been unprecedented in both vitriol and scale. 
<br>Much of this harassment was fueled by disinformation, misogyny, biphobia, and a monetized social media environment where a woman’s allegations of domestic violence and sexual assault were mocked for entertainment. The same disinformation and victim-blaming tropes are now being used against others who have alleged abuse.
<br>In our opinion, the Depp v. Heard verdict and continued discourse around it indicate a fundamental misunderstanding of intimate partner and sexual violence and how survivors respond to it. The damaging consequences of the spread of this misinformation are incalculable. We have grave concerns about the rising misuse of defamation suits to threaten and silence survivors.
<br>We condemn the public shaming of Amber Heard and join in support of her. We support the ability of all to report intimate partner and sexual violence free of harassment and intimidation."
