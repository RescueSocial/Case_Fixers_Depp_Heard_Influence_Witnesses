"Amber Heard saw Dr. Bonnie Jacobs from 2011-2014. She stopped seeing her in 2014 and began seeing Dr. David Kipper's friend Dr. Connell Cowan from 2014-2016. Both she and Johnny Depp saw Dr. Amy Banks in 2015. They had a joint session with her and then Dr. Banks saw Depp alone once and Heard alone twice. They started seeing the couples therapist Dr. Laurel Anderson in late 2015 near the end of their relationship. This was after they saw Dr. Amy Banks. Heard returned to Dr. Bonnie Jacobs as of 2019.
